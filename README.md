# Netflix-Database-Management-System
This project aims to create and manage a database for Netflix, the world's leading subscription-based streaming service. Netflix provides a seamless experience for users to sign up, log in, and enjoy a variety of content across different profiles. This project captures essential user requirements and implements a robust database structure to support these functionalities. The database includes information about user sign-ups, login sessions, content, subscriptions, payments, watchlists, and mobile games.
